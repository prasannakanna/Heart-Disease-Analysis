        <h1>About This Project</h1>

        <p>
            Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality
            worldwide. Understanding risk factors and health patterns
            through data visualization can help improve awareness and
            preventive care.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project uses Tableau dashboards and stories to analyze
            patient health indicators such as cholesterol levels,
            lifestyle habits, smoking patterns, and diabetes risk.
        </p>

        <p>
            By combining data analytics with visualization, the project
            aims to make healthcare insights more accessible to students,
            healthcare professionals, and policymakers.
